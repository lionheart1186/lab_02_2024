# Introduction

This exercise uses 
measurements of carbon dioxide from the laboratory on Mauna Loa, Hawaii,
that was started by C. David Keeling in 1958.

## Downloading CO~2~ Data from Mauna Loa Observatory

In 1957, Charles David Keeling established a permanent observatory on Mauna Loa,
Hawaii to make continuous measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The 
observatory has been running ever since, and has the longest record of direct 
measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. The location was chosen 
because the winds blow over thousands of miles of open ocean before reaching
Mauna Loa, and this means the CO~2~ measurements are very pure and 
uncontaminated by any local sources of pollution.

We start by downloading the data from <`r mlo_url`>. The code here checks to 
see if the file already exists, so we don't download it again every time we 
build this report.

```{r download_mlo_data, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
if (!file.exists('_data/mlo_data.csv')) {
  download.file(mlo_url, '_data/mlo_data.csv')
}
```

After downloading the data, we process it, following the worked example in the
instructions:

```{r import_mlo_data, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
mlo_data = read_csv('_data/mlo_data.csv', 
                    skip = 57,  # skip the first 57 rows
                    col_names = c('year', 'month', 'date.excel', 'date',
                                  'co2_raw', 'co2_raw_seas', 
                                  'co2_fit', 'co2_fit_seas',
                                  'co2_filled', 'co2_filled_seas'),
                    col_types = 'iiiddddddd', 
                    # ^^^ the first three columns are integers and the  next 
                    # 7 are real numbers
                    na = '-99.99' 
                    # ^^^ interpret -99.99 as a missing value
) %>% clean_names()
```
```{r simplify_mlo_data, include = TRUE}
mlo_simple = mlo_data %>% select(year, month, date, co2 = co2_filled)
```
```{r plot_mlo_annual_2, include = TRUE, warning=FALSE, , fig.cap="Raw and seasonally adjusted measurements of atmospheric CO~2~, from Mauna Loa, with a legend identifying the different lines."}
mlo_data_adjusted = mlo_simple %>% 
  mutate(co2_annual = slide_vec(co2, mean, .before = 5, .after = 6))
```
```{r calc_mlo_trend, include = TRUE}
library(broom)
co2_fit = lm(co2 ~ date, data = mlo_simple)
co2_trend = coef(co2_fit)['date']
```

# Exercises

## Exercises with CO~2~ Data from the Mauna Loa Observatory

Using the `select` function, make a new data tibble called `mlo_seas`, from 
the original `mlo_data`, which only has two columns: `date` and 
`co2_seas`, where `co2_seas` is a renamed version of `co2_filled_seas` from the 
original tibble.

```{r make_mlo_seas, include=TRUE}
mlo_seas = mlo_data %>% select (date, co2_seas = co2_filled_seas)

head
```

Now plot this with `co2_seas` on the _y_ axis and `date` on the _x_ axis,
and a linear fit:

```{r plot_mlo_seas, include = TRUE}
# TODO
# put your R code here
# remember to use geom_smooth to include a linear fit.

ggplot(mlo_seas, aes(x = date, y = co2_seas)) + geom_line() + labs( x = "Date", y = "Co2 Concentration (PPM)", title = "Seas Chart")
```

Now fit a linear function to find the annual trend of `co2_seas`. Save
the results of your fit in a variable called `fit_seas`, and extract the
trend in CO~2~ concentration to a variable called `trend_seas`.

```{r fit_mlo_seas, include=TRUE}
# TODO
# put your R code here to set trend_seas
fit_seas = lm(co2_seas ~ date, data = mlo_seas)

library(broom)
tidy(fit_seas)

trend_seas = coef(fit_seas)['date']
print(trend_seas)
print(co2_trend)

```

Compare the trend you fit to the seasonally adjusted data to the trend of the 
raw `co2_filled` data, from the workecd exampled. 
You can get the trend for the worked example from the variable `co2_fit`,
which was defined above, in the code chunk `calc_mlo_trend`.

**Answer:** The slope of the seasonal trend is slightly higher at `r format_md(trend_seas, digits=3)` compared to the raw data trend (`r format_md(co2_trend, digits=3)`).

## Exercises with Global Temperature Data from NASA

We can also download a data set from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies
(GISS), which contains the average global temperature from 1880 through the 
present.

The URL for the data file is stored in the variable `giss_url` so you 
don't have to type it in here.

Download this file and save it in the directory 
`_data/global_temp_land_sea.csv`.
You may want to use `if (! file.exists(...))`, as in the example above of
downloading the CO~2~ data, to avoid downloading the 
file again if it already exists in your `_data` directory.

```{r download_giss_temp, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
if (! file.exists('_data/global_temp_land_sea.csv')) {
  download.file (giss_url, '_data/global_temp_land_sea.csv')
}
```

* Open the file in Excel or a text editor and look at it.

* Unlike the CO~2~ data file, this one has a single line with the 
  data column names, so you can specify `col_names=TRUE` in `read_csv`
  instead of having to write the column names manually.

* How many lines do you have to tell `read_csv` to skip?

* `read_csv` can automatically figure out the data types for each column,
  so you don't have to specify `col_types` when you call `read_csv`

* This file uses `***` to indicate missing values instead of `-99.99`, so you
  will need to specify `na="***"` in `read_csv`.  
  
  For future reference,
  if you have a file that uses multiple different values to indicate missing
  values, you can give a vector of values to `na` in `read_csv`:
  `na = c('***','-99.99', 'NA', '')` would tell `read_csv` that if it finds 
  any of the values "***", "-99.99", "NA", or just a blank with nothing in it,
  any of those would correspond to a missing value, and should be indicated by
  `NA` in R.
  
Now read the file into R, using the `read_csv` function, and assign
the resulting tibble to a variable `giss_temp`

```{r read_giss_temp, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here to call read_csv and read "global_temp_land_sea.csv"
# and assign the data to a variable giss_temp

giss_temp = read_csv('_data/global_temp_land_sea.csv', col_names = TRUE, skip = 1, col_types = 'idddddddddddddddddd', na = '***')

head(giss_temp)
```

Something is funny here: Each row corresponds to a year, but there are columns
for each month, and some extra columns called "J-D", "D-N", "DJF", "MAM", "JJA",
and "SON". These stand for average values for the year from January through 
December, the year from the previous December through November, and the seasonal
averages for Winter (December, January, and February), 
Spring (March, April, and May), Summer (June, July, and August), and Fall 
(September, October, and November).

The temperatures are recorded not as the thermometer reading, but as 
_anomalies_. If we want to compare how temperatures are changing in different 
seasons and at different parts of the world, raw temperature measurements are 
hard to work with because summer is hotter than winter and Texas is hotter than 
Alaska, so it becomes difficult to compare temperatures in August to 
temperatures in January, or temperatures in Texas to temperatures in Alaska
and tell whether there was warming.

To make it easier and more reliable to compare temperatures at different times
and places, we define anomalies: The temperature anomaly is the difference 
between the temperature recorded at a certain location during a certain month 
and a baseline reference value, which is the average temperature for that month
and location over a period that is typically 30 years.

The GISS temperature data uses a baseline reference period of 1951--1980, so 
for instance, the temperature anomaly for Nashville in July 2017 would be
the monthly average temperature measured in Nashville during July 2017 minus
the average of all July temperatures measured in Nashville from 1951--1980.

The GISS temperature data file then averages the temperature anomalies over all
the temperature-measuring stations around the world and reports a global average
anomaly for every month from January 1880 through the latest measurements
available (currently December 2020).

Let's focus on the months only. Use `select` to select just the columns for 
"Year" and January through December (if you are selecting a consecutive range
of columns between "Foo" and "Bar" in the tibble `df`, you can call 
`select(df, Foo:Bar)` or `df %>% select(Foo:Bar)`).
Save the result in a variable called `giss_monthly`

```{r make_giss_monthly, include=TRUE}
giss_monthly = giss_temp %>% select ('Year':'Dec')
head(giss_monthly)
```

Next, it will be difficult to plot all of the data if the months are organized 
as columns. What we want is to transform the data tibble into one with three 
columns: "year", "month", and "anomaly". We can do this easily using the 
`pivot_longer` function from the `tidyverse` package.
See the worked examples for an example of using `pivot_longer()`.

Here are examples of using `pivot_longer` on a variable `df`:
`pivot_longer(df, cols = -Year, names_to = "month", values_to = "anomaly")`
or 
`df %>% pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = "month", values_to = "anomaly")` 
will gather all of the columns except `Year` (the minus sign in the argument to
`cols` means to include all columns except the ones indicated with a minus sign) 
and:

* Make a new tibble with three columns: "Year", "month", and "anomaly"
* For each row in the original tibble, make rows in the new tibble for each of 
  the columns "Jan" through "Dec", putting the name of the column in "month" 
  and the anomaly in "anomaly".

Now you try to do the same thing to the `giss_monthly` data. 
Use `pivot_longer` to organize the data to have three columns:
one for the year, one for the name of the month, and one for the 
temperature anomaly in that month.
Store the result in a new variable called `giss_g`

```{r pivot_longer_giss, include=TRUE}
giss_g = giss_temp %>% pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to= 'month', values_to = 'anomaly')

head(giss_g)

```

Remember how the CO~2~ data had a column `date` that had a year plus a fraction
that corresponded to the month, so June 1960 was 1960.4548?

Here is a trick that lets us do the same for the `giss_g` data set.
R has a data type called `factor` that it uses for managing categorical data,
such as male versus female, Democrat versus Republican, and so on.
Categorical factors have a textual label, but behind the scenes, R thinks of 
them as integer numbers. 
Normal factors don't have a special order, so R sorts the values alphabetically.
However, there is another kind of factor called an ordered factor, which allows
us to specify the order of the values.

We can use a built-in R variable called `month.abb`, which is a vector of
abbreviations for months.

The following command will convert the `month`  column in `giss_g` into an
ordered factor that uses the integer values 1, 2, ..., 12 to stand for
"Jan", "Feb", ..., "Dec", and then uses those integer values to create a new
column, `date` that holds the fractional year, just as the `date` column in
`mlo_data` did:

``` r
giss_g = giss_g %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.abb, ordered = TRUE),
         date = Year + (as.integer(month) - 0.5) / 12) %>% 
  arrange(date)`
```

In the code above, `ordered(month, levels = month.abb)` converts the variable
`month` from a character (text) variable that contains the name of the month
to an ordered factor that associates a number with each month name, such that
'Jan' = 1 and 'Dec' = 12.

Then we create a new column called `date` to get the fractional year 
corresponding to that month. We have to explicitly convert the ordered factor 
into a number using the function `as.integer()`, and we subtract 0.5 because 
the time that corresponds to the average temperature for the month is the 
middle of the month.

Below, use code similar to what I put above to add a new `date` column to
`giss_g`.

```{r add_date_to_giss_g, include=TRUE}
giss_g = giss_g %>% 
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = month.abb, ordered = TRUE),
         date = Year + (as.integer(month) - 0.5) / 12) %>% 
  arrange(date)

head(giss_g)
```

Now plot the monthly temperature anomalies versus date:

```{r plot_giss, include=TRUE, warning = FALSE}
# TODO
# put your R code here
# 
# Here in the comments is an example of the kind of thing you might want to 
# use, but you will need to fill in some details, such as the data and 
# aesthetics for ggplot() and which geometries you want to plot (geom_xxx is not
# a real geometry).
# 
 ggplot(giss_g, aes(x = date, y = anomaly)) + geom_line() + labs(title = 'Temperature Anomalies Over Time', x = 'Year', y = 'Temperature Anomaly')
# # specify the data and the mappings of variables to plot aesthetics
# geom_xxx() + 
# # put the geometries (lines, points, etc) that you want to plot
# labs() + 
# # label the axes
# ... # put any other characteristics here.
```

That plot probably doesn't look like much, because it's very noisy.
Use the function `slide_vec` from the package `slider` to create 
new columns in `giss_g` called `smooth_1` and `smooth_10`, with
1-year (12-month) and 10-year (120-month) sliding averages of the 
anomalies.

Make a new plot in which you plot a thin blue line for the monthly anomaly
(use `geom_line(aes(y = anomaly), color = "blue", alpha = 0.3, size = 0.1)`;
alpha is an optional specification for transparency where 0 means invisible
(completely transparent) and 1 means opaque),
a medium dark green line for the one-year sliding average,
and a thick dark blue line for the ten-year sliding average.

```{r plot_giss_with_smoothing, include=TRUE, warning = FALSE}
# TODO
# put your R code here
# 
# Here is an example of the outline of the kind of code you might want to 
# use, but you will need to fill in the details to make this code work.
# 
# giss_g %>% 
#   mutate( ... ) %>% 
#   # ^^^ fill in code for "..." in "mutate()" to add a columns called
#   # "smooth_1" for the one-year smoothed anomaly 
#   # and "smooth_10" for the ten-year smoothed anomaly.
#   ggplot(aes( ... )) + 
#   # ^^^ Then we send the result of mutate to ggplot() where it becomes the 
#   # data to plot.
#   # Add code for the aesthetics ("...") to map variables to aesthetics.
#   geom_line(aes(y = anomaly), alpha = 0.3, size = 0.1) + 
#   # ^^^ plot a thin blue line with the un-smoothed anomaly
#   geom_line(...) + 
#   # ^^^ Now add a medium "darkgreen" line for the one-year smoothed data
#   geom_line(...) + 
#   # ^^^ And a thick "darkblue" line for the ten-year smoothed data
#   labs( ...) + # Label your axes
#   # ... # add any other plot specifications you need.
```

The graph shows that temperature didn't show a steady trend until starting 
around 1970, so we want to isolate the data starting in 1970 and fit a linear 
trend to it.

To select only rows of a tibble that match a condition, we use the function 
`filter` from the `tidyverse` package:

`data_subset = df %>% filter( conditions )`, where `df` is your original tibble
and `conditions` stands for whatever conditions you want to apply.
You can make a simple condition using equalities or inequalities:

* `data_subset = df %>% filter( month == "Jan")` to select all rows where the 
  month is "Jan"
* `data_subset = df %>% filter( month != "Aug")` to select all rows where the 
  month is not August.
* `data_subset = df %>% filter( month %in% c("Sep", "Oct", "Nov")` to select all 
  rows where the month is one of "Sep", "Oct", or "Nov".
* `data_subset = df %>% filter(Year >= 1945)` to select all rows where the year 
  is greater than or equal to 1945.
* `data_subset = df %>% filter(Year >= 1951 & year <= 1980 )` to select all rows
  where the year is between 1951 and 1980, inclusive.
* `data_subset = df %>% filter(Year >= 1951 | month == "Mar")` to select all 
  rows where the year is greater than or equal to 1951 or the month is "Mar".
  this will give all rows from January 1951 onward, plus all rows before 1951
  where the month is March.

Below, create a new variable `giss_recent` and assign it a subset of `giss_g` 
that has all the data from January 1970 through the present. Fit a linear trend 
to the monthly anomaly and report it.

**What is the average change in temperature from one year to the next?**

```{r giss_trend, include=TRUE}
# TODO
# put your R code here
# 
# create giss_recent
# 
# fit a linear trend to the data using lm()
# 
# print the coefficients of the trend.
```

### Did Global Warming Stop after 1998?

It is a common skeptic talking point that global warming stopped in 1998.
In years with strong El Ni&ntilde;os, global temperatures tend to be higher
and in years with strong La Ni&ntilde;as, global temperatures tend to be lower.
We will discuss why later in the semester.

The year 1998 had a particularly strong El Ni&ntilde;o, and the year set a 
record for global temperature that was not exceeded for several years. Indeed, 
compared to 1998, it might look as though global warming paused for many years.

We will examine whether this apparent pause has scientific validity.

To begin with, we will take the monthly GISS temperature data and convert it to
annual average temperatures, so we can deal with discrete years, rather than 
separate temperatures for each month.

We do this with the `group_by` and `summarize` functions (see the 
examples and explanation in the worked examples document).

We also want to select only recent data, so we arbitrarily say we will look at
temperatures starting in 1979, which gives us 19 years before the 1998 
El Ni&tilde;o.

If we go back to the original `giss_g` data tibble, run the following code:

```{r summarize_giss, include=TRUE}
# TODO
# When you are ready to run the code below, you can un-comment it in RStudio
# by deleting the "#" at the beginning of each line.

# giss_annual = giss_g %>% 
#    filter(Year >= 1979) %>%
#    group_by(Year) %>% 
#    summarize(anomaly = mean(anomaly)) %>%
#    ungroup() %>%
#    mutate(date = Year + 0.5, before = Year < 1998)
```

This code groups the giss data by the year, so that one group will have
January--December 1979, another will have January--December 1980, and
so forth.

Then we replace the groups of 12 rows for each year (each row represents one 
month) with a single row that represents the average of those 12 months.

It is important to tell R to `ungroup` the data after we're done working with
the groups.

Finally, we set `date` to `year + 0.5` because the average of a year corresponds 
to the middle of the year, not the beginning and we introduce a new column 
`before`, which indicates whether the data is before the 1998 El Ni&ntilde;o:

Now plot the data and color the points for 1998 and afterward dark red to
help us compare before and after 1998.

```{r plot_recent_giss, include=TRUE, warning = FALSE}
# TODO
# Here is more example code that you can uncomment and run after you get the 
# code in the preceding chunks to run properly.
 
# ggplot(giss_annual, aes(x = date, y = anomaly)) +
#   geom_line(size = 1) +
#   geom_point(aes(color = before), size = 2) +
#   scale_color_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "darkblue", "FALSE" = "darkred"),
#                      guide = "none") + 
#   # ^^^ color "before" points dark blue, "after" points dark red.
#   # guide = "none" tells ggplot not to show a legend explaining the colors.
#   labs(x = "Year", y = "Temperature Anomaly")
```

Does it look as though the red points are not rising as fast as the blue points?

Let's just plot the data from the years 1998--2011. Use the `filter` function
to select just the date from the years 1998--2011 and pass that to `ggplot`.

```{r plot_pause, include=TRUE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here
# Filter the giss_annual data to select only the years >= 1998
# plot the data
```

Now how does it look?

Let's use the `filter` function to break the data into two different data sets,
which we will store in tibbles called `giss_before` and `giss_after`: 
`giss_before` will have the data from 1979--1998 and the other, 
`giss_after` will have the data from 1998 onward 
(note that the year 1998 appears in both data sets).

Also, use the `mutate` function to add a column called `timing` to each of the 
split data sets and set the value of this column to "Before" for `giss_before` 
and "After" for `giss_after`.

```{r split_giss_data, include=TRUE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here
```

Now use `lm` to find the trend in temperature data in `giss_before`
(from 1979--1998) and assign it to a variable `giss_trend`.

Next, add a column `timing` to each of the split data sets and set
the value of this column to "Before" for `giss_before` and "After" for
`giss_after`.

```{r get_trend_before, include=TRUE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here
```

Next, combine the two data frames (or tibbles) into one, 
using the `bind_rows` function.
If you have created the data frames `giss_before` and `giss_after`, then you 
can un-comment the code below to combine them.

```{r combine_giss, include=TRUE, warning = FALSE}
# TODO
# After you have created two data frames or tibbles, giss_before and giss_after,
# then you can un-comment the line of code below and it will run.
# I have commented it because it will cause an error if you knit the document 
# before you add code to create those data frames.
# 
# giss_combined = bind_rows(giss_before, giss_after)
```

Now let's use ggplot to plot `giss_combined`:

* Aesthetic mapping:
  * Use the `date` column for the _x_ variable.
  * Use the `anomaly` column for the _y_ variable.
  * Use the `timing` column to set the color of plot elements
* Plot both lines and points.
  * Set the `size` of the lines to 1
  * Set the `size` of the points to 2
* Use the `scale_color_manual` function to set the color of
  "Before" to "darkblue" and "After" to "darkred"
* Use `geom_smooth(data = giss_before, method="lm", 
  color = "blue", fill = "blue", alpha = 0.2, fullrange = TRUE)` 
  to show a linear trend that is fit just to the `giss_before` data.

```{r plot_combined, include = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here.
```

Try this with the parameter `fullrange` set to `TRUE` and `FALSE` in the 
`geom_smooth` function. What is the difference?

What this plot shows is the full data set, and a linear trend that is fit just 
to the "before" data. The trend line shows both the best fit for a trend
(that's the solid line) and the range of uncertainty in the fit (that's the 
light blue shaded area around the line).

If the temperature trend changed after 1998 (e.g., if the warming paused, or if
it reversed and started cooling) then we would expect the temperature 
measurements after 1998 to fall predominantly below the extrapolated trend line, 
and our confidence that the trend had changed would depend on the number of 
points that fall below the shaded uncertainty range.
